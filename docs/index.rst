What is CREASE?
===============

Computational Reverse Engineering Analysis for Scattering Experiments (CREASE) originally developed by Daniel Beltran-Villegas, Michiel Wessels, and Arthi Jayaraman (References 1, 2, and 3 below) is a two step approach that takes as input small angle scattering profile [I(q) vs. q] and provides as output structural information of the assembled structure.  It combines a genetic algorithm (GA) as the first step with molecular simulations based reconstruction as the second step. For macromolecular solutions at dilute concentrations, when the primary component of [I(q) vs. q] is the form factor of the assembled structure, the two steps of CREASE provide structural information about the assembled structure ranging from dimensions of the domains as well as the chain- and monomer- level packing (as shown in References 1, 2, 3, and 5). The work in Reference 4 below describes early implementation of CREASE to analyze input small angle scattering profiles when the structure factor is the primary component of [I(q) vs. q]. 

This open source crease_ga package has been co-created by Zijie Wu, Ziyu Ye, Christian Heil, and Arthi Jayaraman at the University of Delaware and focuses on the first genetic algorithm (GA) step of CREASE.
