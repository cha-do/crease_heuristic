    "**This tutorial has been created by Ziyu Ye, Zijie Wu, and Arthi Jayaraman to accompany their publication: Ye, Z.; Wu, Z; Jayaraman, A.

    "In general, Computational Reverse Engineering Analysis for Scattering Experiments (CREASE) is a two-step approach that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) as the first step with molecular simulations based reconstruction as the second step to determine for a given input scattering profile the structural features of assembled structures in macromolecular solutions. Structural features range from aggregate dimensions to the chain- and monomer- level packing within the aggregate. This tutorial presents CREASE for vesicles. If you use CREASE in your work, we ask that you please cite one of the relevant papers below. If you use this vesicle code, please cite Reference 5. \n",

    "This notebook presents a tutorial on how the first step of CREASE, the GA step, works to determine the structural features of the assembled structure (vesicle in this tutorial) found in macromolecular solutions from small angle scattering intensity profiles, I(q)s. The GA code takes as input an I(q) and finds the structural dimensions of the vesicle whose computed scattering profile, $I_{comp}(q)$, best matches the input I(q). The GA code presented here is applicable to a vesicle structure with an empty (solvent filled) core and three layers (two solvophilic layers and one solvophobic layer). But it can be adapted to other shapes and geometries by slight modifications of the code that will be highlighted as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GA code for vesicles is able to determine:\n",
    "1. Vesicle dimensions: the core radius ($R_{core}$), the inner solvophilic A layer thickness ($t_{Ain}$), the middle solvophobic B layer thickness ($t_{B}$), and the outer solvophilic A layer thickness ($t_{Aout}$) \n",
    "2. How the solvophilic scatterers are split between inner ($s_{Ain}$) and outer ($1-s_{Ain}$) layers.\n",

    "Let's start with the initial arguments that the user needs to choose and input for their system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell block below, the user needs to specify the arguments that define the basic architecture of the genetic algorithm:\n",
    "* number of individuals in a population (`pop_number`)\n",
    "* number of generations that GA runs for (`generations`)\n",
    "* number of binary digits used to represent each individual (`nloci`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The user chooses the above three arguments to run the GA. The choice of these three arguments will significantly affect the performance of the GA. We recommend that the user test out different combinations of these three parameters to ensure convergence to the right output. For the vesicle example, after multiple tests during our previous work, we recommend the following values for these arguments for reliable performance of GA on vesicle:\n",
    "* `pop_number = 80`\n",
    "* `generations = 100`\n",
    "* `nloci = 7`\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the computational time needed to complete the GA run increases with increasing number of individuals and generations, for the purpose of completing this tutorial within reasonable time within a jupyter notebook, we use the following values:\n",
    "* `pop_number = 10`\n",
    "* `generations = 2`\n",
    "* `nloci = 7`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not expect to see the 'best' $I_{comp}$(q) matching the input or target $I$(q) with these settings. With a larger number of individuals and generations, you can see how the GA predictions evolve over the generations to higher \"fitness\" structures [i.e. closer match to the input $I$(q)].\n",
    "\n",
    "For each individual in the GA, we store information about structural features as genes in its genome. For each of the individual's genes, the information is encoded as a seven-bit (chosen by the user as $n_{loci}$, set in this tutorial as 7) binary sequence that corresponds to the value of structural dimensions evenly distributed between the minimum and maximum bounds set by the user (minimum bound will be 0000000, and maximum 1111111). The choice of the number of binary bits will determine the precision of the final optimized structural dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "*You may ask at this point - why are we encoding the parameters in a binary fashion?*\n",
    "That is a great question! Actually, whether to use binary or decimal encoding has always been a topic of debate in the field of genetic algorithm. Traditional GAs tend to use binary coding (referred to as 'binary-coded GA'), but there also have been numerous applications of GA to engineering problems using \"decimal coding\" (often referred to as 'real-coded GA'). We developed the algorithm following the binary coding route, but there is technically no reason why one cannot use real-coded GA for this problem. One can always rewrite our genetic operator algorithms if one wishes to use real-coded GA (more on this later)"

    "\n",
    "Regardless of the type of assembled shape (vesicles, micelles, etc.), each shape requires the user to choose a set of shape descriptors that defines the basic morphology of the structure. In this example, we use the `vesicle` shape, which requires the following 7 shape descriptors (specified as a list given *exactly* in the following order with the `shape_params` argument):\n",
    "* Number of scatterers used to represent a chain (${num}_{scatterers}$)\n",
    "* Number of monomers in a chain ($N$)\n",
    "* Occupied volume fraction of the scatterers in the domain occupied by solvophobic B blocks ($\\eta_B$)\n",

    "* Diameter of a monomer of chemistry A ($l_{mono,a}$）[Angstrom]\n",
    "* Fraction of monomers in chain that are of B type ($f_B$)\n",

    "\n",
    "For vesicles assembled from amphiphilic macromolecules with solvophilic A and solvophobic B blocks, two types of scatterers (A and B, respectively) are randomly placed within the designated vesicle layer boundaries (more details to be given later). The ratio of A and B scatterers matches the composition of the amphiphilic macromolecule (1−$f_B$:$f_B$).  We note that the scatterers could be point scatterers or scatterers with a specified diameter, the latter being the case in this example (for reasons described in the reference [5]). Regardless of the choice, the total number of A and B scatterers is another choice that the user has to make to balance the accuracy of the output vesicle dimensions from GA and the computational time for the $I_{comp}$(q) calculation (more details to be given later).\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The determination of $I_{comp}$(q) in the GA only uses the scatterer placements and these placements do NOT include any connectivity to resemble macromolecules [i.e. no polymer chains are placed].\n",
    "\n",
    "In this vesicle example, the user can enter the macromolecular information about the solution that was used to obtain the scattering profile to guide the choice of number of scatterers placed in the individual candidate structure. Here for this tutorial example, we use the molecular information for a diblock copolymer with the solvophilic block A and solvophobic block B forming the vesicle bilayer. The diblock chain has total number of  𝑁 monomer beads with $f_B$ fraction of the beads in the chain being solvophobic. The occupied volume fraction of the scatterers in the domain occupied by solvophobic B blocks, defined as total occupied volume by scatterers of chemistry B divided by total volume of B layer, is given by $\\eta_B$ and the diameters of the A and B beads (or \"monomer contour length\") are given by $l_{mono,a}$ and $l_{mono,b}$, respectively. The specific values used in this example are given in the code block below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this vesicle system example, we calculate each individual's $I_{comp}$(q) using $n_{LP}$ different replicates/configurations of random scatterer placements to generate the averaged $I_{comp}$(q) for that individual. Having multiple configurations of scatterer placements mitigates the risk that one configuration of scatterer placements biases the computed scattering intensity. One could also choose to replace the use of multiple ($n_{LP}$=7 in this case) placements of fewer scatterers with just one placement using a significantly higher total number of scatterers per unit volume (i.e., scatterer density, can be changed by varying ${num}_{scatterers}$) to reduce bias compared to using fewer scatterers (or smaller scatterer density). We choose to use multiple different configurations of random scatterer placements in this case to incorporate the ability to capture dispersity in dimensions (more details will be found later). We also note that the computational cost of $I_{comp}$(q) scales quadratically with the number of scatterers used, providing another reason for multiple replicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed discussion on the `shape_params` arguments and scatterer density in the specific case of CREASE for vesicles, please see reference [5]. We note that a future update to this code will replace ${num}_{scatterers}$, $N$, $\\eta_B$, $l_{mono,a}$, and $l_{mono,b}$ with a single parameter that directly sets the number density of scatterers (relevant for structure resolution) allowing for a more intuitive user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting bounds for GA parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "The user also sets the maximum (`maxvalu`) and minimum (`minvalu`) bounds for each parameter (or gene) of the individual candidate structure. For the vesicle system example, the GA determines the following parameters:\n",
    "* Core radius ($R_{core}$) \n",
    "* Three individual layer thicknesses in the bilayer consisting of the inner solvophilic A layer ($t_{Ain}$), middle solvophobic B layer ($t_{B}$), and the outer solvophilic A layer ($t_{Aout}$) \n",
    "* Split of the solvophilic scatterers between inner and outer layers ($s_{Ain}$)\n",
    "* Dispersity in the core radius dimension ($\\sigma_{R}$)\n",
    "* Negative $log_{10}$ of background intensity ($-log_{10}(bg)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The structural parameters (core radius and the three layer thicknesses) in the vesicle shape are coded in Angstroms ($A$), and `q` is given in inverse Angstroms ($A^{-1}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to reiterate, different shapes will have different sets of shape descriptors and parameters, so the aforementioned lists of shape descriptors, parameters and their definitions only apply to the vesicle shape. It is important for the user to make sure that the shape descriptors and minimum/maximum bounds of the parameters correspond to the expectation of the chosen shape.\n"

The `converttoIQ` function is what ties the different shapes to the GA code during implementation. Each shape will have its own `converttoIQ` that takes as input a list of q values (`qrange`) and a list of parameters (the \"gene\"), and outputs a list of $I_{comp}$(q) values corresponding to the input `qrange`. If the user would like to use crease_ga for his/her own morphology (other than vesicle) and/or analytical model (instead of using Debye scattering equation), the `converttoIQ` method will be the only part of the code that will need to be modified.

    "As discussed during the tutorial, GA for vesicles can incorporate the effect of dispersity in the dimensions of the assembly into the calculation of the individual's $I_{comp}$(q). This dispersity is determined as one of the GA results given as $\\sigma_{R}$ in this example system where dispersity is incorporated in the core radius dimension. **Figure 2** shows how the GA with (i.e. GA searches and optimizes for $\\sigma_{R}$) and without (i.e. GA sets $\\sigma_{R} = 0$) dispersity performs in getting the vesicle structural dimensions of core radius ($R_{core}$), each layer thickness ($t_{Ain}$, $t_{B}$, $t_{Aout}$) and total vesicle diameter size ($D_{vesicle}$). We can see that with an appropriate population size and number of generations, the GA is able to accurately capture the target structure's dimensions. Additionally, while the analytical fitting to a core-multi-shell model using SASVIEW can also determine these structural dimensions, GA for vesicle is able to inform the user how the molecules are split between the inner and outer layers of the vesicle wall ($s_{Ain}$), a piece of molecular information not available if the core-multi-shell model is used instead. The GA determined parameter $s_{Ain}$ gives the fraction of molecules in the vesicle assembly that occupies the inner layer of the vesicle walls. For this example system, the target structure has 20% of the molecules in the assembly occupying the inner layer of the vesicle wall and the GA is able to determine $s_{Ain}$ as 28%, matching the target value.\n",

    "In Figure 3, we show another example where GA is applied to an *in silico* sample where dispersity exists not only in the core radius, but also in all other dimensions including the thicknesses of the three layers. Among the GA parameters, however, we still only incorporate dispersity in the core radius ($\\sigma_{R}$), but not the other dimensions. In this more challenging task, GA (with or without dispersity in core radius) outperforms the core-multi-shell model used in SASview significantly in all the dimensions, with SASView-predicted values in general falling out of the uncertainty range.\n",
